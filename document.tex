\section{Introduction}

This document contains the architecture and functional requirements for the Buzz Discussion Board system. It will start with a brief  vision and background to explain the need for such a system from where the architecture and functional requirements will follow.

\section{Vision}

\textit{"A short discussion of the project vision, i.e. what the client is trying to achieve with the project
and the typical usage scenarios for the outputs of the project."}

\section{Background}

\textit "A general discussion of what lead to the project including potentially:"

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit business/research opportunities,
\item \textit opportunities to simplify/improve some aspect of life/work or community,
\item \textit problems your client is currently facing,
\item \textit ...
\end{itemize}
